# XOR-Encryption-and-Decryption
User can encrypt files with the help of an key. This is a symmetric encryption, i.e., the same key is used for encryption and decryption. This was implemented in C++.

Here the user can enter the answer key, with the help of the key any type of file gets encrypted.

## Usage:
- To encrypt the file, make sure the file is in the same directory as the source code and enter the filename in the program and a key. 
- This will create a new file with an extension ".sec".

- To decrypt the file, enter the filename of the encrypted file (with the extension ".sec") and the same key which was used to encrypt the file. 
- If the correct key is entered, the a new decrypted file is created again with the extension ".sec" (The encryption and decryption algorithm are same).
